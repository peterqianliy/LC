/* 
 * 1. Instruction
 *  You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
 *  Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can  *  you climb to the top?
 * 2. Failures:
 *  #1 recursive: time limit exceeded.. -->> iterative, bottom-up: 1) base
 *  case, 2) figure out EVERY step 
 * 3. New idea:
 *  Here, M[n] = M[n-1]+M[n-2] does not mean sth about last step taking one or two, 
 *  but rather M[n] meaning n steps to go, M[n-1] (n-1) steps to go and M[n-2] (n-2) to go. See below:
