/* Given an n*n 2D matrix representing an image
* Rotate the iamge by 90 degrees (clockwise).
* 
* Follow up: 
* Do it in place
*
* Thoughts:
* 1. If in place, the value in temp variable must be used before next iteration.
*
* Solution:
* 1. Generalization (with contrast to Deduction) 
*    Define matrix as collection square layers. Iterate layer by layer; Within each layer rotate by 90.
*   
* History:
* 10/14 Learnt solution from somewhere else
* 01/16 Solved it myself after several attempts.
